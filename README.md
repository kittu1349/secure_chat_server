# secure_chat_server
i have not yet started working on this project
this is just a self-learning project
so basically this project is going to be based on various concepts like 
+ input sanitization
+ waf against xss, sqli and various other vulnerabilities
+ saving data securely in database
+ 2FA based login
+ stfp implementation
+ chat transmission encoded in vignere cipher (a polyalphabetic substitution, not really secure but just for fun)
+ websocket implementation for exactly two clients on a line at a time
+ i will add more maybe or not
