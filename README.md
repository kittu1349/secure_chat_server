# secure_chat_server
[!WARNING] this project is not for production neither it is complete, i know nobody is reading this but still 
+ i have started working on this project
+ this is just a self-learning project
+ so basically this project is going to be based on various concepts like 
[] input sanitization
[] waf against xss, sqli and various other vulnerabilities
[] saving data securely in database
[x] session based login
[] stfp implementation
[] chat transmission encoded in vignere cipher (a polyalphabetic substitution, not really secure but just for fun) or any encryption
[x] secure authentication coding practice
